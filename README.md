# Used-Car-Price-Predictor
In this project, my main aim was to create a predictor which is quick, reliable, and accurate. I have explored different algorithms and implemented different models to compare their R2 scores.

# Result
The best performance was given by SVR with the ‘rbf’ kernel. For a Dataset obtained from Kaggle, the predictor had an R2 score of 0.941.
